CONNECTING SHOPPING CART WITH USER ACCOUNTS

Add a column in the Users table with name CartID
create a relationship with the ShoppingCart table on CartID column in ShoppingCart and Users

when user creates account, check the cookie if there is a CartID already stored
if there is, connect that shopping cart with that user
in other words,
if there is a CartID already in the cookie, set it to the CartID value of the currently logged in User, but if there is already a value for CartID for the currently logged in user, do not overwrite the value.
